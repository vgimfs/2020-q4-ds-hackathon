    "## Key Result -- Modeling Success:\n",
    "\n",
    "The error of our prediction should be better than random or a simple constant term. Anything that improves on this baseline is a modeling success.\n",

    "### Metric for modeling success key result: \n",
    "\n",
    "We are looking for people to come up with a model that takes all historical data including everything but today’s “actual” cashflow (and the “estimate_to_actual” value) and comes up with a better estimate of today’s estimate_to_actual ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each process_date, each portfolio we would like a better estimate that can be used on a go-forwards basis to better predict cashflows based on MSAE vs the observed “estimate to actual”)\n",
    "## Key Result -- Learning Success:\n",
    "Any approach we take should make intuitive sense, teach us something new about the data and be replicable on different samples.\n",
    "### Metric for learning success: \n",
    "Documentation of the experimentation process that is easily understood and accepted by the business. Code that can be implemented by a FST into the rebalancing process. \n",

    "# The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a PM in EIG, when you are looking at our funds in the morning you may notice there is a difference in the actual amount of cash flow you received yesterday compared to what was projected to come in for the close (estimate cash amount), when you signed off at end of day yesterday. There are couple reasons why the cash flow is estimated and why the estimate is not always accurate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NAVs for our funds are determined after the market close. We can't know the exact NAV prior to market close to calculate the cash flow of the fund for today, so we need to use yesterday's NAV to estimate. The market movement over the day can lead to valuation differences between the estimates (which is prior day's NAV) and the actuals, which get todays NAV.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is certain activity from an estimate standpoint that can get processed after 4:00pm, and therefore, we would only see it on the actual cash flow files the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There can be intraday processing corrections in the estimated cash figures but are offset and don't appear in the actual cash flow the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Certain clients can submit their trades as late as 8am the next day and still get prior days NAV. This would bypass the estimate feed and only show up on the actual feed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These differences in cash flows can result in our funds sitting on too much cash or being leveraged unexpectedly due to unknown client activity. For all funds, this can result in a few hundred million dollars of unexpected cash flow across the complex that the PMs were unaware of and thus were unable to invest on their benchmark date."

    "# The Opportunity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to the concerns involved in the unexpected cash flow that PMs have to deal with, given the estimated cash flow you receive every day, can you give a prediction of the difference between the estimate and the actual cash flow for each fund every day? \n",
    "\n",
    "If we predict these differences, then we can take these predictions into account when positioning our funds at the end of each day, helping us become better positioned by reducing the leverage or cash next morning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the problem and a possible solution let's summarize the research question: Can we predict how much new cash flow we are expecting before market close 4pm ET and the next morning by using historical Fund of Funds cash flow data? Feel free to use other public data sources such as info from St. Louis Federal Reserve Data, which is provided in the makerlab environment."
